            "content": ". I have recently taken a great NLP course by deeplearning.ai (Andrew Ng) called &quot;Sequence Models&quot;. I always like to start a new project after learning a new skill. So, I found this interesting dataset in Kaggle Fake and real news dataset. The objective is to make an algorithm able to determine if an article is fake news or not. . I applied my learnings on this dataset and hope in this way I can share what I learned with you. . Solution Framework . There are two csv files in this Kaggle datatset each containing a list of articles considered as &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;real&quot; news. . The picture below shows the steps we will be taking in order. We&#39;ll explain the details of each step throughout the notebook. . . # Input data files are available in the &quot;../input/&quot; directory. # For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory import os for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(&#39;/kaggle/input&#39;): for filename in filenames: print(os.path.join(dirname, filename)) # Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output. . /kaggle/input/fake-and-real-news-dataset/True.csv /kaggle/input/fake-and-real-news-dataset/Fake.csv /kaggle/input/glove42b300dtxt/glove.42B.300d.txt .

Combine fake and true dataframes . Create a new column &#39;truth&#39; showing whethere the news is fake or real. Then, concatenate two datasets into one dataframe. We can choose to use either &#39;title&#39; or &#39;text&#39; column or concatenated &#39;title+text&#39; for training. But, for the sake of processing time, we&#39;ll only use &#39;title&#39;. . true[&#39;truth&#39;] = 1 fake[&#39;truth&#39;] = 0 df = pd.concat([true, fake], axis=0, ignore_index=True) df.shape . (44898, 5) . Text Cleaning . We need to clean the text first. If you start searching on the text cleaning domain, you realize there are many different techniques. But you may need just a few methods for the purpose of your NLP task. There are many good resources for text clearning. But, I mainly looked up the following resources for my text cleaning in this notebook: https://machinelearningmastery.com/clean-text-machine-learning-python/ https://mlwhiz.com/blog/2019/01/17/deeplearning_nlp_preprocess/ Here are 5 steps that give decent text cleaning result for this task: . Replace contractions In English, a contraction is a word or phrase that has been shortened by dropping one or more letters, such as “I’m” instead of “I am”. We can either split the contractions (“I’m” to “ I ”+” ’m ”) or convert them to their full format (“I’m ” to “I am”). In my experience the latter works better as it&#39;s harder to find a word embedding for sub-words like “ ‘m “. | Removing punctuation We want the sentences without punctuations like commas, brackets, etc. Python has a constant called string.punctuation that provides a list of punctuation characters. We’ll use this list to clean our text from punctuations. | Splitting into words In order to remove stopwords, we first need to split the text into words. We do this with word_tokenize function by NLTK. This function splits the text based on white space and punctuation. | Removing stopwords Stopwords are common words like “the”, “and”, … which don’t add much value to the meaning of the text. NLTK has a list of these words that can be imported and used to remove them from the text. | Removing leftover punctuations I noticed after all this cleaning, there were still some words like “…but” with dots in them. I added this last step to clean them up. Normalizing by case is also common practice. But, since we are using keras tokenizer later, we can skip this step as tokenizer does this step by default. There are other preprocessing techniques of text like Stemming, and Lemmatization. However, in the realm of deep learning NLP they are not necessary anymore. | %%time def clean_text(txt): &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; cleans the input text in the following steps 1- replace

Name: data_cleaned, Length: 44898, dtype: object . Prepare train and test datasets . Use the usual train_test_split by sklearn to split the data. . xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(df[&#39;data_cleaned&#39;], df[&#39;truth&#39;], shuffle=True, test_size=0.2) # find the length of the largest sentence in training data max_len = xtrain.apply(lambda x: len(x)).max() print(f&#39;Max number of words in a text in training data: {max_len}&#39;) . Max number of words in a text in training data: 227 . Tokenize the input training sentences . In most of the NLP tasks, we need to represent each word in the text with an integer value (index) before feeding it to any model. In this way, the text will be converted to a sequence of integer values. One of the ways of doing that is with Keras. Keras provides an API for tokenizing the text. Tokenizer in Keras finds the frequency of each unique word and sort them based on their frequency. It then assigns an integer value starting from 1 to each word from the top. You can see the index mapping dictionary by reading tokenizer.word_index. . There are two distinct steps in tokenizing in this way: . fit_on_texts: We&#39;ll fit the tokenizer on our training data to create the word indices | texts_to_sequences: using the word index dictionary from step above, we take this step to transform both train and test data. | Here, we set num_words to a limit such as 10000 words. num_words is a parameter that defines the maximum number of words to keep, based on the word frequency. Keras actually keeps (num_words-1) words. We can leave the num_words to &#39;None&#39; and tokenizer will pick all the words in the vacabulary. . Padding and truncating the input training sequences . All your input sequences to the model need to have the same length. In order to achieve that, we can use a function that pads the short sequences with zeros (options are &#39;pre&#39; or &#39;post&#39; which pads either before or after each sequence). It also truncates any sequence that is longer than a predefined parameter &quot;maxlen&quot;. Truncating also has the option of &#39;pre&#39; or &#39;post&#39; which either truncates at the beginning or at the end of the sequences. . max_words = 10000 tokenizer = text.Tokenizer(num_words = max_words) # create the vocabulary by fitting on x_train text tokenizer.fit_on_texts(xtrain) # generate the sequence of tokens xtrain_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(xtrain) xtest_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(xtest) # pad the sequences xtrain_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xtrain_seq, maxlen=max_len) xtest_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xtest_seq, maxlen=max_len) word_index = tokenizer.word_index print(&#39;text example:&#39;, xtrain[0]) print(&#39;sequence of indices(before padding):&#39;, xtrain_seq[0]) print(&#39;sequence of indices(after padding):&#39;, xtrain_pad[0]) . text example: As US budget fight looms Republicans flip fiscal script sequence of indices(before padding): [47, 2455, 615, 996, 3704, 118, 2692, 3534] sequence of indices(after padding): [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 47 2455 615 996 3704 118 2692 3534] . Word embedding using pre-trained GloVe vectors . Now that we have tokenized the text, we use GloVe pretrained vectors. Word embeddings is a way to represent words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.  Using word embedding through GloVe, we can have a decent performance with models with even relatively small label training sets. . You can download GloVe pre-trained word vectors from the link below. There are different sizes of vocabulary and embedding dimension available. . https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ . Load the GloVe vectors . %%time embedding_vectors = {} # with open(&#39;/kaggle/input/glove6b100d/glove.6B.100d.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as file: with open(&#39;/kaggle/input/glove42b300dtxt/glove.42B.300d.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,encoding=&#39;utf-8&#39;) as file: for row in file: values = row.split(&#39; &#39;) word = values[0] weights = np.asarray([float(val) for val in values[1:]]) embedding_vectors[word] = weights print(f&quot;Size of vocabulary in GloVe: {len(embedding_vectors)}&quot;) . Size of vocabulary in GloVe: 1917494 CPU times: user 4min 21s, sys: 6.44 s, total: 4min 27s Wall time: 4min 27s . Create an embedding matrix with the GloVe vectors . The embedding matrix has a shape of (vocabulary length, embedding dimension). . Note tht vacab_len is equal to max_words if we set that limit when tokenizing. Otherwise, vocab_len is equal to lenght of all words in word_index+1. . Each row of the embedding matrix belongs to one word in the vocabulary (derived from xtrain) and it contains the weights of embedding vector of that word. . In the code below, we initialze the embedding matrix with zeros. If a word in our word_index is not found in the embedding vectors from GloVe. . The weight of that word remains as zero. Below, you can see print out of the some example words that are out of vacabulary (OOV). . #initialize the embedding_matrix with zeros emb_dim = 300 if max_words is not None: vocab_len = max_words else: vocab_len = len(word_index)+1 embedding_matrix = np.zeros((vocab_len, emb_dim)) oov_count = 0 oov_words = [] for word, idx in word_index.items(): if idx &lt; vocab_len: embedding_vector = embedding_vectors.get(word) if embedding_vector is not None: embedding_matrix[idx] = embedding_vector else: oov_count += 1 oov_words.append(word) #print some of the out of vocabulary words print(f&#39;Some out of valubulary words: {oov_words[0:5]}&#39;) . Some out of valubulary words: [&#39;brexit&#39;, &#39;antitrump&#39;, &#39;reutersipsos&#39;, &#39;protrump&#39;, &#39;blacklivesmatter&#39;] . print(f&#39;{oov_count} out of {vocab_len} words were OOV.&#39;) . 210 out of 10000 words were OOV. . Modeling . Now, we can create a model and pre-train the embedding layer with the embedding matrix we just created based on GloVe vectors. You can see the model overview below. . The model architecture looks like the picture below. Although tokenizing is not part of the modeling, it&#39;s nice to show that this step is taken before feeding the text data to the LSTM models. This model is similar to one of the programming assignments in the &quot;Sequence model&quot; course. But, one of the LSTM layers are removed as it turned out that adding that extra layer doesn&#39;t help and even cause some overfitting. . The first layer of the model is Embedding. Embedding layer by Keras is a flexible layer that can be used also without any pre-trained weights. In that case, the Embedding layer is initialized with random weights and will learn an embedding for all of the words in the training dataset. In this exercise, we will set the weights of the Embedding layer to the embedding matrix from GloVe pre-trained vectors.This is a tranfer learning. . Another parameter in Embedding layer is &quot;trainable&quot; which can be set to True in case you want to fine-tune the word embedding or if you don&#39;t want the embedding weights to be updated you can set it to False. Here, we set it to False. . After the Embedding layer, we have a layer of LSTM or GRU and then a Dropout layer for regularization. . Then we have a Dense layer with Sigmoid activation which transforms the output of previous layers to 0 or 1 (real or fake). . . Model Overview . LSTM .

Train accuracy: 99.96 Test accuracy: 98.88 . As you can see in this example both GRU and LSTM perform similarly. Given the lower complexity of GRU, perhaps GRU is a better choice here. . There you have it. You learned all steps required to write a text classifier using pre-trained word embeddings such as GloVe and an LSTM or GRU model. . Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve this notebook. Thank you. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
