Hi and welcome! I'm Sepideh, and I'm currently an AI and DSP Algorithm Designer in Ericsson Canada. I'm a MSc graduate from Chalmers University of Technology (located in beautiful GÃ¶teborg, Sweden), where I majored in Digital Signal Processing and Wireless Communications. 

This blog is mainly a place to record and detail my learnings and I'm hoping that would help someone out there. That being said, I'm still a learner and if you have anything to point out, please leave them in the comments! I would love to hear your feedback and ideas.
